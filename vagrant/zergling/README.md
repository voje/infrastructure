# Zergling
Quick Virtualbox VM. Tested on Windows with Virtualbox.   

## HyperV on Windows
Using Virtualbox as the hypervisor since supports more out-of-the-box features than HyperV.

```ps1
# Admin privileges shell or click OK a few times.
$ vagrant up
```
Use Default Switch (WSL DHCP didn't work for me).

## Libvirt on Linux
Make sure you're using up-to-date `vagrant` and 
up-to-date `vagrant-libvirt` package.
